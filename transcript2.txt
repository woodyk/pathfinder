For the Data sources it should be an open database configuration option supporting the most common data base types. the core database will be elastic search. Research data will be kept in structured documents for searching and further analytics. The application needs to be familiar with using elasticsearch and you will need to create a document map for the database. If you are doing something lighter say for personal use you should be using mysql or sqlite. Evaluate the best option then format the data storage and retrieval to the most efficient method for search and analytics on the data you collect. We also need to be able to store photos and other media data attached to pathfinder target groups. Think through this a bit and give me any questions you may have. 2. Data collection will be a bit more open ended at first when it comes to hardware. A table builder for new data types or templates should exists. Say you have a common form type that needs to be parsed the same way every time for your method of research or osint collection. You can go into the menu or via command line in this GPT and have the format analyzed and stored for future parsing when that data type is seen. Then the sql or elasticsearch document formatting can be updated as expected. A text based natural language query mechanism for working with the data that is available will be required. The idea is that you can load say 100 files that go on the filesystem and then request they all be analyzed for a particular target group or subject. That information is then added to a knowledge base for that specific project or investigation. Investigation being the top level for the grouping. So every investigation will have it's own knowldege base. That knowledge base can be either elasticsearch or a mysql or sqlite instance. The user feed back mechanism is a method for taking in feed back into the model to reinforce data collected. When the user sees something that is liked a user can use a thumbs up or down to validate its worth. When doing corolation and analytics on case data or research data it is always good to be sure we look for data that might be linked even in separate investigations. Searches on targets / nouns should be taken into consideration and the data checked against other cases to see if there are valid links. A string board display may be an interesting feature to make association for people using the application to visualize it how law enforcement do in the movies. Look into the things that researchers, case workers and law enforcement use for visual investigative techniques.

For behavioral analysis take into account the target / suspect / nouns information in total. As it grows the profile should also grow. Look into psychological details, behavioral details such as persistant or frequent locations seen, food preferences based on restaurants and Also take into account the over all profile of a case. As a case grows there will be patterns to the way each case either has links to others or each cases profile it self. For example, frequent gang mentions, patterns in a particular tattoo or the frequency they are seen, crime rates, specific types of crimes vs others but remember this is a research tool to for individuals or geeks. Instead of being law enforcement only it has to take into account usage by students, journalists, scientists and more. Take the template provided for law enforcement and apply it to types of research groups that would use a tool like this. Come up with a few other groups that need this and answer the questions you gave me with similar answers given to create a usage template for the type of work you are doing. Example, the string board idea, come up with a unique one for each researcher type or a few for that matter. To start with the application does not require infrastructure to run. It can be a stand alone application with compliment mobile additions in the future. At the moment there are no compliant standards to meet. The AI model and the application must have the standard analytics tool kits that analysist use. The AI must be adaptable to the applications usage and learn from the methods used to sift through data and come up with conclusions. Learning its own users methods to get to answers and pairing the understanding of what the user is trying to get to with getting to that answer as fast as possible. Remembering methods is important because it solidifies problem solving techniques.

The application also needs to take in multiple data formats, images, videos, documents and run OCR analysis on them. Also facial recognition and object detection. Also object change. For example the ability to highlight an object on a video and ask that if it disappears or changes create an event. An "if-then" capability would be good for monitoring or searching through video for a particular change then taking note and marking that event to be looked at when the run is complete. Also take into account the reasonings for that "if-then object" event. The AI needs to be savey enough to make associations. Node relational data k-neighbors and other algorythems need to be available. The "analyse" and "search" functions need to be attuned to research and detective style work.

Review the examples and answers given to the questions provided and come up with further features sets and answers the other questions that account for my thinking methods and prompting. Add them to the list and try to be highly focused on data aggregation and solution finding in detective work. Remember we need to get strait to factual answers quickly but accurately. Take into account the complexity of the application. It has to be intuitive and easy to use. Got a document or a note to add. The note and document can just be attached and hit enter and filed. A time series data base needs to be available for displaying a time line of events. Think a slider on the bottom of the application with events marks across a zoomable or expandable time line. Do your research, hit play on the time line and get analysis and predictions based on that play. Essentially a visualization of all the data and timeline information in an easy to use bar on the bottom. The potential for play counts to see if solutions change or become very similar may be a method for weeding out things not needed. Again review the information I have given you for the application and contemplate further requirements. This is the first application run and does not need to be fully featured but must be usable.
